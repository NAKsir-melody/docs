## Web app architectures

`create-near-app` currently supports several application architectures depending on whether you want to write smart contracts in Rust or AssemblyScript (not recommended for financial applications)

|                |    Rust     |  AssemblyScript |
|---------------:|:-----------:|:---------------:|
| **Vanilla JS** |     Yes     |       Yes       |
| **React**      |     Yes     |       Yes       |
| **others?**    |      **     |       **        |

```

### Rust and React

*This configuration is currently not supported*

### AssemblyScript and Vanilla JS

```

## Development

No matter which architecture you choose to use, `create-near-app` includes several convenience scripts in `package.json` to help speed up your workflow:

```json
{
  "scripts": {

    "dev": "nodemon --watch assembly -e ts --exec 'npm run start'",
    
    "test": "npm run build:contract && jest test --env=near-shell/test_environment --runInBand",

    "start": "CONTRACT_NAME=$(cat neardev/dev-account) parcel src/index.html",
    "prestart": "npm run build:contract && npm run dev:deploy:contract",
    
    "build": "npm run build:contract && npm run build:web",
    "build:web": "parcel build src/index.html --public-url ./",
    "build:contract": "mkdir -p out/ && gulp",
    
    "deploy": "npm run build && npm run deploy:contract && npm run deploy:pages",
    "deploy:pages": "gh-pages -d dist/",
    "deploy:contract": "near deploy",
    "dev:deploy:contract": "near dev-deploy"
  },
}
